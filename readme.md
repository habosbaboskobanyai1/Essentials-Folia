# Essentials-Folia

This repository is a fork of [EssentialsX](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials) specifically modified to work with Folia. The main difference lies in the use of a patch file to apply the necessary changes. This guide will explain how to set up, use, and maintain this fork.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Git
- Bash (if you are on Windows, you can use Git Bash or WSL)
- Java Development Kit 21 (JDK) to compile the plugin

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Euphillya/Essentials-Folia.git
cd Essentials-Folia
```

### Using the Script

A Bash script is provided to manage recloning, creating, and applying patches. Here's how to use it:

### Update the Repository by Recloning

To update the source code by deleting and recloning the original EssentialsX repository:

```bash
./script.sh updateUpstream
```

This command will:
1. Remove the local directories `Essentials` and `Essentials-Patchs`.
2. Re-clone the `EssentialsX` repository into the `Essentials` directory.
3. Copy the contents of `Essentials` to `Essentials-Patchs`.

### Create Patches

To create patches from changes made in the `Essentials-Patchs` directory:

```bash
./script.sh createPatches
```

Patches will be generated in the `patches/plugins` directory.

### Apply Patches

To apply existing patches to the `Essentials-Patchs` directory:

```bash
./script.sh applyPatches
```

This command will apply each patch found in `patches/plugins` and create a commit for each applied patch.

## Directory Structure

- `Essentials/`: Cloned directory from the original EssentialsX repository.
- `Essentials-Patchs/`: Working directory where modifications are made and patches are applied.
- `patches/plugins/`: Directory containing the generated patch files.
